# Contact-Mgmt-System

This Python program allows you to manage your contacts with features like adding, editing, deleting, searching, displaying all contacts, and exporting them to a text file called contacts.txt. Phone numbers are used as unique identifiers for contacts in this system, so this system will not allow duplicate phone numbers.

These four fields are stored:
 - Name
 - Phone Number (Key; validated format: XXX-XXX-XXXX)
 - Email Address (validated format)
 - Additional Information

The system will greet you with a welcome message and display a menu. You can choose from the following options:
(Note: Options 2 through 6 will be disabled if there are no contacts yet)
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact 
4. Search for a contact 
5. Display all contacts 
6. Export contacts to a text file 
7. Quit

Follow the prompts to interact with the system and manage your contacts.
