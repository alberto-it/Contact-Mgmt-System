# Contact Management System

This Python program allows users to manage their contacts with features like adding, editing, deleting, searching, displaying all contacts, and exporting all contacts to a text or CSV file. Phone numbers are used as unique identifiers, so a feature to prevent the overwriting of contact data by adding a phone number that already exists in the system was added.

These four fields are stored:
 - Name
 - Phone Number (key; validated format: XXX-XXX-XXXX)
 - Email Address (validated format)
 - Additional Information

The system greets the user with a welcome message and displays a menu of choices.
The user can choose from the following options (note: 2 through 7 will be disabled to start):
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact 
4. Search for a contact 
5. Display all contacts 
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Export contacts to a csv file
8. Quit

The user follows the prompts to interact with the system to manage contacts.
