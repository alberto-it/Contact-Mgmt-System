# Contact Management System

This Python program allows users to manage their contacts with features like adding, editing, deleting, searching, displaying all contacts, and exporting all contacts to a text file called contacts.txt. Phone numbers are used as unique identifiers in this system, so a feature to not allow duplicate phone numbers was added.

These four fields are stored:
 - Name
 - Phone Number (Key; validated format: XXX-XXX-XXXX)
 - Email Address (validated format)
 - Additional Information

The system will greet the user with a welcome message and display a menu.
The user can choose from the following options (note: 2 through 6 will be disabled to start):
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact 
4. Search for a contact 
5. Display all contacts 
6. Export contacts to a text file 
7. Quit

Follow the prompts to interact with the system and manage contacts.
